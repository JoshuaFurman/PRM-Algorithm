# PRM-Algorithm
3D PRM Algorithm
This is a school project for my Intro to Robotics class, 
we were asked to implement the PRM algorithm on a 3D world space containing 2 cubes and 2 spheres. 
This data is contained in a text file and is read into the program via this file. 
An obstacle free path from the specified starting point and goal point is determined by dijkstra's algorithm and written to an
output file.
